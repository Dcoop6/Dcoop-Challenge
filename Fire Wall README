This program conists of the following three files:

Main:
This is file consists of a main class and method with test cases that use the Firewall class to demonstrate
the fuctionality of the accept_packet method.

FirewallInterface:
This file consists of the interface that is implemented in the Firewall class. It dictates the structure of the Firewall Class.

Firewall:
This file consists of the Firewall class , which implements the Firewall Interface. In this class, supplied packet characteristcs are
tested in a manner that will short circuit as soon as an invalid parameter is found. Additionally, the Firewall objects have one private
data member, filename, which is the .csv file name that is supplied to the constructor. There are also 4 private methods that each test one
of the four parameters for a packs and return a boolean value.

Notes:
#1 If I had been given more time, I would have liked to have built a test harness to run through all the variations on inputs, instead
of the handful of edge cases used in the main class.

#2 In the portion of the code that tests the IP address , there is a nested for loop, which I would have liked to reduce the big O complexity
but did not come up with a more efficient solution in the alotted time.

#3 Thank you for checking out my code!
